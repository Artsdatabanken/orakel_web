  "About": {
    "App": "Artsorakel is developed by the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (NBIC, Artsdatabanken) in collaboration with Naturalis Biodiversity Center. The app attempts to identify species in pictures using machine learning.",
    "Model_training": "The recognition model is trained at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, using pictures that are publicly available on artsobservasjoner.no. When the app is used, the model will say which of the species it has been trained on is most similar. This means that it can only suggest species that are present in norwegian nature and that have been reported with pictures. It therefor only knows species in the wild (no people, pets, pure garden plants, etc.) and provides answers on a species level (and some subspecies).",
    "Server_storage": "Pictures are sent to the server for recognition. Pictures and user information are not available to the NBIC or any third party.",
    "Read_more": "You can learn more about Artsorakel on <2>NBIC's website (in Norwegian)</2>. Questions and feedback may be sent to <4>support@artsobservasjoner.no</4>."
